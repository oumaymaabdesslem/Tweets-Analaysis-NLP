# Tweets-Analaysis-NLP

Goals :
* Master the twitter API for extracting tweets
* Master the NLP (natural language processing) part with NLTK in Python
* Apply the principles of data cleaning
* Classify tweets: group together tweets that are similar.


## Getting Started
first should be created twitter account,
you can consult the following links: 
* https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api 
* https://developer.twitter.com/en



## Extraction twitter data (twwepy + pandas)
### Importing owr libraries
### Creating a twitter App
### Tweets Extraction (11356 tweets)
### Creating a DataFrame of each tweets then conctenate all the tweets and save in CSV file



## processing tweets

### Drop Duplicates
### Cleaning tweets :
          * Remove Punctuation
          * Remove Emoji
          * Remove URLs
          * Converting all tweets to lower case
          * Remove Number
          .....

## Data Pre-Processing : NLP( Natural Languages Processsing)
###### NLTK is a powerful Python package that provides a set of diverse natural languages algorithms. It is free, opensource, easy to use, large community, and well documented. NLTK consists of the most common algorithms such as tokenizing, part-of-speech tagging, stemming, sentiment analysis, topic segmentation, and named entity recognition. NLTK helps the computer to analysis, preprocess, and understand the written text.
